    "abstract": "The coast of the Red Sea in Jeddah City is home to a unique microbial community that has adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Therefore, it is essential to characterize the microbial community in this unique microbiome to predict how environmental changes will affect it. The aim of this study was to conduct metagenomic sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS rRNA genes for the taxonomic classification of the microbial community in soil samples associated with the halophytic plants ",
